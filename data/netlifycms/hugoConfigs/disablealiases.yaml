label: disableAliases
name: disableAliases
widget: boolean
field_type: boolean
required: false
hint: Will disable generation of alias redirects. Note that even if
  disableAliases is set, the aliases themselves are preserved on the page. The
  motivation with this is to be able to generate 301 redirects in an .htaccess,
  a Netlify _redirects file or similar using a custom output format
